Title : "Bangladesh: Make India observer in forum of Islamic nations: Bangladesh | India News - Times of India"

"NEW DELHI: In a move likely to displease Pakistan, Bangladesh has sounded the first official call to induct countries with large Muslim populations, like India, as observers to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , a club which has only Muslim majority countries as its members.\nAt a meeting of OIC foreign ministers in Dhaka on Saturday, Bangladesh minister Abul Hasan Mahmood Ali called for reforms in the organisation that can pave the way for countries like India, which are not Muslim majority, to get an observer seat in the OIC.\nThough Pakistan is unlikely to welcome the proposal as it uses the forum to regularly target India, the list of likely candidates also includes its “all-weather” ally China and Bangladesh has also put forward the “inclusion” argument to say that large Muslim populations should not be denied a say at the OIC. Muslims in India constitute 10% of the global adherents of the faith.\nEgypt, with a population of 92 million, is 5% of the global Muslim population. In terms of Muslims as a percentage of the global population, India ranks third after Indonesia and Pakistan. Ali said, “A number of countries, not OIC members, have a large number of Muslims as their citizens. The Muslims may be minority in those countries, but in terms of number they often exceed the total population of many OIC member countries.”\n“There is a need to build bridges with those non-OIC countries so that a large number of Muslim populations do not remain untouched by the good work of OIC. That is why reforms and restructuring is critical for OIC,” the Bangladesh foreign minister said. Calling for reforms of the organisation to make it more contemporary, Ali said, “We need to rethink our work, method and process of functioning to cater to the needs of the current era and beyond.”\nBangladesh’s suggestion received support of the OIC secretary general. This is not the first time there has been a call to bring countries like India into the ambit of the OIC, but Pakistan has always held a veto position. In the past decade, however, India’s relations with the Islamic world have undergone aconsiderable transformation.\nFormer Saudi ruler Abdullah had, in 2006, proposed that India become an observer in OIC. But that did not go anywhere. In the 1990s, Pakistan has used the OIC to hit out at India on J&K. As recently as September 2017, India refuted egregious comments on J&K by Pakistan at the UN. Pakistan was speaking on behalf of the OIC.\n“The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has no locus standi on India’s internal affairs, we strongly advise the OIC to refrain from making such references in future,” India said. The OIC statements mean less these days because a number of OIC countries privately dissociate themselves from the grouping, considering it more of an irritant.\nThis has prevented India from engaging more meaningfully with the organisation even though India has fairly robust relations with most member states."

"Englishmate States like Bihar, UP, MP keeping India backward: NITI Aayog’s Amitabh Kant Speaking at Jamia Millia Islamia University, Kant said, “Eastern part of India particularly states like Bihar, UP, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is keeping India backward especially on social indicators.” india Updated: Apr 24, 2018 13:25 IST Press Trust of India, New Delhi Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant speaks at a panel discussion on 'The City that Never Sleeps : Cities of Tomorrow' during the last day of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2017 in Hyderabad.(PTI File Photo) \nNITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Monday said that the states in India’s southern and western region were growing rapidly, but those like Bihar, UP and Chattisgarh were keeping the country backward. \nSpeaking at the first Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan Memorial Lecture at Jamia Millia Islamia University, Kant said, “Eastern part of India particularly states like Bihar, UP, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is keeping India backward especially on social indicators. While we have have improved on ease of doing business, we have remained backward on human development index. We are still 131 out of 188 countries in HDI.” \n“While we have improved on ease of doing business, we have remained backward on human development index. We are still 131 out of 188 countries in HDI.” \nTalking on ‘Challenges of Transforming India,’ kant said the southern and western part of India were doing reasonably well and growing rapidly. \n“And when the country’s HDI has to improve and we have to focus on these social indicators. We are working on these things through Aspirational Districts Programme,” he said. \nEmphasising upon the importance of sustainable growth, Kant said, “Education and health are critical and these are areas in which India is lagging behind. Our learning outcomes are poor - a class 5 student is not able to do class 2 substraction. Class 5 student is not able to read his mother tongue. Infant mortality rates are very high. Unless we improve on these aspects, it will be difficult to grow in a consistent way.” \nHe also pitched for women’s participation in decision making process. \n“There must be a conscious effort to frame policies to give women opportunities,” he said. \nVice Chancellor of the university Talat Ahmad was also present. tags "

"April 28, 2018 ‘Pink Moon’ 2018: April’s Full Moon Rises This Sunday Venus and Jupiter will also be visible to the naked eye on April 29, ahead of the Pink Moon. Darkfoxelixir / Shutterstock Alexandra Lozovschi Venus and Jupiter will also be visible to the naked eye on April 29, ahead of the Pink Moon.\nAfter the March Blue Moon , here comes the April Pink Moon right on schedule. The full moon of April — or Pink Moon, as it is called — will light up the sky on April 29, at 8:58 p.m. EDT (00:58 GMT on April 30), Space.com reports .\nAccording to the Old Farmer’s Almanac , the Pink Moon gets its name from one of earliest-blooming, widespread flowers in North America — wild ground phlox, also known as grass pink or “moss pink.” These are among the first spring flowers and often bloom around the time of April’s full moon, covering the grown in a pink blanket of blossoms.\nBut the April full moon goes by many other names, including the Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon, and the Fish Moon. This last moniker is due to the influx of shad fish that swim upstream to spawn during this time of year.\nSky watchers in New York, Newark, and Atlantic City will be able to see the nearly full moon rise at 7:31 p.m. EDT, while the sun is still lingering. In the New York City skyline, the two celestial bodies will be sharing the spotlight for 20 minutes, until the 7:51 p.m. EDT sunset.\nObservers in Philadelphia can catch the April full moon rising at 7:35 p.m. EST. In Miami, the Pink Moon will rise at 7:41 p.m. EDT and share the sky with the sun for no more than nine minutes, notes Space.com , citing timeanddate.com . April full moon 2018: When is the Pink Moon and what is the best time to see it? https://t.co/bp95PhD9WQ\n— Hank Cookie Rich (@HankCookieRich) April 27, 2018\nThe reason why the full moon emerges during daylight in some locations has to do with its place around our planet’s orbit. For some, the moon appears full a day before and after the actual full phase. The elliptical orbit of the moon also plays a role in how we perceive the eight phases, from the full moon to the new moon and everything in between.\nIn advance of the Pink Moon, Venus and Jupiter will also be visible to the naked eye on Sunday. Jupiter will rise shortly before the April full moon, at 8:31 p.m. EDT, while Venus will be high on the sky as early as 7:19 a.m. EDT, reaching 21.7 degrees above the horizon for New York City.\nAs the first full moon of spring, the April Pink Moon is usually a Paschal Moon, used to pinpoint the dates for Easter and Passover. However, this year the second full moon of March (the March 31 Blue Moon) became Paschal Moon instead."

Title : "UP Board Result 2018: All students in 150 schools fail in UP Boards"

"ALLAHABAD: At least 150 schools across the state, mostly situated in districts marked as ‘sensitive’, scored perfect zero as none of the students in these institutions cleared either class X or XII examinations conducted by Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UPSEB). Following it, board officials are mulling seeking explanation from them.\nThe record shared by the board shows that 98 schools had 0% result in class X and 52 in class XII. These included government, aided as well as private schools. Secretary, UPSEB, Neena Srivastava told TOI, \"This year strict measures were adopted by the state government to check copying. Apart from it, there is a possibility of only a dozen or so students appearing from such schools so we will decide on the fate of all such educational institutes when the board will reopen.\" The board is closed for three days after announcing the result on Sunday + .\nIn record mass exit, over 10 lakh quit UP board exams in 4 days UPSEB secretary Neena Srivastava told TOI that the reason for such a high dropout rate could be steps taken by the government to crack down on education mafia that is known to facilitate mass copying.\nShe further said, \"The board will analyse the results and after it explanation could be sought from principals of these schools in case of a negative report.\" This year, 50 districts out of the total of 75 were declared ‘sensitive’ by UPSEB. Ghazipur district topping the chart of sensitive district had 17 schools where all students were declared unsuccessful. In 11 schools, all examinees failed in class X while in six schools, all students of class XII couldn’t clear the examination.\n‘Cheat pupils’ say quit exams over UP govt crackdown The UP government’s policy of zero tolerance to cheating in the ongoing state board exams seems to have paid off, deterring lakhs of students who hoped to sail through via different means of cheating.\nAllahabad district which gave the state topper Anjali Verma also earned the dubious distinction of having six schools where none of the students were declared successful. Azamgarh also has six schools with perfect zero. Five such schools each are in Bahraich, Mirzapur, Mau and Hardoi. The other districts having at least one such school are Auraiya, Kaushambi, Kannauj, Mathura, Lakhimpur Kheri, Mainpuri, Aligarh, Ambedkar Nagar, Hathras, Basti, Gorakhpur, Jaunpur, Amroha, Deoria, Lucknow and Agra.\nRead this story in Bengali"

Karnataka Election 2018 Campaign tracker However, he was quick to add that the new-found mutual bonhomie was not indicative of any alliance between JD(S) and BJP, in the event of a hung assembly. “Before the 2014 elections, I had said I would resign my Lok Sabha membership if BJP gets a majority on its own. I decided to resign, but Modi persuaded me against doing so. He said the country needs the experience and services of senior leaders,” Gowda said. Gowda said the PM is a smart politician. “Modi is aware about the happenings in Karnataka politics, and also what Rahul Gandhi said about me.

Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah described Modi’s remark about Gowda as a political statement which clearly showed a “tacit understanding” between BJP and JD(S). “BJP leaders do not criticise JD(S) leaders and vice versa,” he said in Hubbali.

Title : "India Pakistan: India, Pakistan should try to resolve their differences like Koreas: Pak media - Times of India"

"Mon, Apr 30, 2018 | Updated 02.28AM IST Full site India, Pakistan should try to resolve their differences like Koreas: Pak media Updated: Apr 29, 2018, 20:38 IST PTI Highlights India and Pakistan should try to resolve their differences and make the \"quest\" for normalisation and peace the \"noblest of goals\" in the region: Dawn News editorial 'Pakistan and India have forged very different and irreversible histories, whereas the Koreas seek unification' ISLAMABAD: India and Pakistan should try to resolve their differences and make the \"quest\" for normalisation and peace the \"noblest of goals\" in the region, taking a cue from the recent thaw in the relations between North and South Korea, a media report here said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the South Korean President Moon Jae-in, during an inter-Korean summit on Friday, agreed to pursue a permanent peace treaty and denuclearise the Korean peninsula. \"Inevitably, a comparison between the renewed engagement between the two Koreas and the freeze in ties in the South Asian subcontinent will be made. The tensions and disputes between Pakistan and India are fundamentally different to the issues between the Koreas,\" Dawn News said in an editorial. \"Pakistan and India have forged very different and irreversible histories, whereas the Koreas seek unification. Yet, a shared history and the common dreams and aspirations of a people with enduring cultural and other similarities across India and Pakistan make the quest for normalisation and peace in this region the noblest of goals,\" it said. The striking imagery of the Korean summit recalls the unprecedented hope and expectations created by the historic trip to Lahore of the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999. It is time for the leadership of India and Pakistan to once again tread the path of peace and friendship, the editorial said. The India-Pakistan ties again nosedived in recent years with no bilateral talks taking place and both sides putting it on the back-burner. The ties between the two countries had strained after the terror attacks by Pakistan-based groups in 2016 and India's surgical strikes inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The sentencing of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav to death in April last year further deteriorated the bilateral ties."

We have applied to the Election Commission for an approval and are meanwhile doing ground work,” Naven Kumar, a 2015 IIT Delhi graduate, who is leading the group, told PTI. \nThe party members, however, do not wish to jump the gun and aim for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. \n“We do not wish to do a hurried job and end up being reduced to just one of those small political outfits with big ambitions. We will begin with contesting the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections and then aim for the next Lok sabha polls,” Kumar said. \nThe group, which includes members mostly from the SC, ST and OBC communities, feels that the backward classes have not received their due in terms of education and employment. \nAll set with a poster which has pictures of BR Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose and APJ Abdul Kalam, among others, the party has already begun a social media campaign. \n“Once we have the registration, we will form small units of the party which will start working on the ground for our target groups. We also do not wish to pitch ourselves as a rival of any political party or ideology,” Kumar added. \n(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

But the photograph that comes with the information is decidedly not that of Nehru. It's of Narendra Modi . Oops.\nThis mess-up prompted even Congress social media in-charge Divya Spandana to comment , and she sounded distinctly annoyed:\n\"@Google @GoogleIndia what algorithm of yours allows this?! You're so full of junk-\", tweeted Spandana.\n.@Google @GoogleIndia what algorithm of yours allows this?! You’re so full of junk- https://t.co/GHyxh3fEWm\n— Divya Spandana/Ramya (@divyaspandana) 15246657\nWhen one clicks on the Wikipedia link, 'List of Prime Ministers in India', the page correctly describes the Prime Minister's position in India and accurately lists all the country's PMs in the right order - and with the correct photographs next to them.\nRead this story in Bengali\nIf onr didn't bother to click through, though, someone unfamiliar with the country's leaders could well believe Modi is Nehru. By Thursday afternoon, after the issue was brought to Google India's attention, it fixed the issue.\nRead this story in Tamil\nRead this story in Marathi"
