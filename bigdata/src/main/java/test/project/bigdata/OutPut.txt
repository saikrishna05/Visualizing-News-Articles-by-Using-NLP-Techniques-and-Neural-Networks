Title : "Mueller team says it has not gone rogue - CNNPolitics"

"(CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed with special counsel Robert Mueller what prosecutors should pursue in the Russia probe as early as last May, when Mueller was first appointed, the special counsel's office said Thursday.\nAt a court hearing, Justice Department attorney Michael Dreeben said Rosenstein discussed specific legs of the investigation with Mueller months before he wrote a classified memo in August that outlined Mueller's directive. Dreeben argued that the Justice Department shouldn't have to produce documentation of those early talks about the investigation's scope that occurred before Rosenstein's August 2 memo. Rosenstein has been overseeing Mueller's investigation following the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While Rosenstein and Mueller's communication about the Russia probe may help the special counsel's office defend its criminal case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Mueller's team is also indirectly pushing back against the President and Republicans' assertions that the investigation is rogue and corrupt. \"We have an alive and awake acting attorney general who's looking at this investigation, [and] knows what's going on,\" Dreeben said. Read More Manafort has alleged in court that Mueller's office overstepped its authority by charging him with crimes related to his work before the 2016 campaign. His attorney also demanded they see records of Rosenstein and Mueller's discussions before August. \"We're all sitting here guessing what happened. There has to be a record,\" Manafort's attorney, Kevin Downing, said Thursday. Mueller's appointment unfolded in May with a public notice from Rosenstein, directing the special counsel to investigate links between the Russian government and the campaign and other matters that arose from the investigation. The August memo, which was unveiled earlier this month and gets into more specifics, was \"reflective of decisions that had already been made,\" Dreeben said. Rosenstein's August 2 memo gives Mueller the green light to investigate Manafort for his lobbying work in Ukraine, years before the campaign. It also outlines several other still-undisclosed allegations that Mueller could investigate and says Mueller could look into allegations that Manafort colluded with Russians during the campaign. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the foreign lobbying and financial charges. He has not been charged with crimes related to Russian collusion. Downing said, \"We're in a worse place than we were with\" previous special investigations that appeared to wander outside their initial purposes. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, countered that it's unlikely the Justice Department fully knew what Mueller should pursue when he was first appointed. \"As good as he is, I don't think the deputy attorney general could see into the future,\" she said. Investigators shouldn't have to \"start with the conclusion\" that crimes were committed, she added. Instead, prosecutors could follow the question of whether Manafort had links to Russians. That work, even if it didn't connect directly to Manafort's time on the campaign, would be essential to any criminal investigation, she said, and Dreeben later echoed her. Manafort is also challenging the special counsel's office's decision to charge him with both lying to federal authorities and failing to register as a foreign lobbyist and the decision to charge him with a conspiracy money laundering count because of his failure to register his work with federal authorities. Mueller's prosecutors have pushed back on both arguments on technical legal grounds. If Manafort were to convince the judge to dismiss the money laundering allegation, assets that the government locked down following his indictment in October would become available to him."

Title : "Inside Paul Manafort's 6-month fight to meet his $10 million bail"

"As former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort arrives at a federal courthouse later today for a hearing to dismiss his case, as well as to suppress evidence seized by federal agents, one thing will not change -- the ankle bracelet he has been wearing since he was indicted in late October as part of a strict, court-imposed home confinement. The 69-year-old Manafort has repeatedly -- unsuccessfully -- sought to provide the court with enough property, cash and other assets to meet the $10 million bail amount set by federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson in his case involving felony charges of money laundering, false statements, conspiracy and failure to register as a foreign agent.\nEach time, the judge has rejected his proposals, as the case against him centers largely around his complex finances and alleged bank fraud related to a mortgage on one of his properties he sought to offer as partial backing for his bail. The bank fraud charges are now included in a separate indictment in a federal court in Virginia.\nJackson has expressed irritation in multiple proceedings, particularly on the issue of bail, as lawyers for each side have fought over the real, unencumbered value of Manafort’s many properties.\nSeptember trial date set for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\nGrand jury returns new charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\nFormer Trump aide Rick Gates pleads guilty to 2 counts in Russia investigation\nJacquelyn Martin/AP, FILE\nPaul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, leaves the federal courthouse in Washington, Nov. 6, 2017. He has struggled to pay his bail of $10 million.\nThe twists and turns of this bail saga have included odd movie references -- no Manafort isn’t a \"Jason Bourne\" figure, though he has multiple passports, his lawyer has argued -- the real estate website Zillow , and a healthy dose of sarcasm and frustration.\nAt one point in his nearly six-month-long quest to shed his GPS ankle device and other restrictions, like on his travel, Manafort had his physician write a letter to the judge pleading for leniency, saying the defendant’s health was at stake, according to the judge.\n\"While he's subject to home confinement, he's not confined to his couch, and I believe he has plenty of opportunity to exercise,\" the judge sarcastically said in a January status hearing.\nManafort’s permanent residence, he has said, is in tony Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.\nIn a February proceeding, the judge blasted Manafort attorney Kevin Downing for trying to offer a home value printed off Zillow.\n\"Zillow is actually considered to be pretty accurate, Your Honor,\" said Downing, a former Justice Department lawyer.\nJackson shot back, \"If you had to sell it tomorrow or insure it tomorrow or refinance it tomorrow, you would get an appraisal. You wouldn't print out a page from Zillow.\"\nThe judge has repeatedly rejected a number of properties the veteran political strategist has offered to back his $10 million bail, most recently last week refusing to accept his condo in Alexandria, Virginia, as it’s already being used to back yet another home’s mortgage, and his flat in New York City, which is part of the tax and bank fraud case in Virginia.\nNeither property would be unencumbered to back his bond, the judge said, should the court decide to revoke bail and seize his properties.\nComplicating the Manafort financial picture could also be the fact that prosecutors, who are part of special counsel Robert Mueller 's team investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 campaign, seized accounts at three different banks, according to recently revealed court documents filed by Mueller's team after Manafort’s attorneys complained that the government was not being forthcoming about warrants it had obtained against their client.\nThe Associated Press\nRobert Mueller\nNo charges against Manafort so far have included his time or work on the Trump campaign.\nThe public should learn more about Manafort’s bail soon, as both sides in the case agreed this week to have the transcripts of two private discussions with the judge released with limited redactions concerning personal information. One proceeding in February was entirely about Manafort’s bail.\nManafort’s jury trial before Jackson is set to begin Sept. 17; his trial in a federal court in Virginia is on track to start in just three months. Manafort could potentially spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted in either case. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nBut there are signs that the veteran lobbyists could finally have his bail conditions relaxed. While she denied his latest request, the judge offered a virtual asset road map in which the court highlighted a list of five specific residences owned by the defendant it would accept, along with a combination of cash and marketable securities.\nIt was as if the judge wanted to write the bail package herself, and at this rate, perhaps it would be faster if she did.\n Inside Paul Manafort's 6-month fight to meet his $10 million bail "

"\nPresident Trump called Mrs Bush a \"wonderful, wonderful person\" at a news conference on Wednesday. \n\"She was a woman of proud patriotism and profound faith,\" Mr Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago resort. \nDonald Trump has had a difficult relationship with the Bush family, most significantly in his run against Jeb Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Title : "Sen. Booker Violates Constitution: Voting Against Pompeo for Religious Beliefs"

"Sen. Booker Violates Constitution: Voting Against Pompeo for Religious Beliefs Mark Wilson/Getty Images/Joe Raedle/Getty Images by Ken Klukowski 16 Apr 2018 COMMENTS ? WASHINGTON, DC – Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced on Friday that he will vote against CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s nomination to become secretary of state because of Pompeo’s beliefs on marriage and sexuality — beliefs consistent with Pompeo’s Christian faith. Conservative leaders are now denouncing Booker’s vote as a violation of the Constitution’s Religious Test Clause. Booker sharply questioned Pompeo on Thursday during the nominee’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, referring to words Pompeo spoke at a church in his district when the current director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was still serving in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nPompeo has also supported efforts to defend marriage as the union between one man and one woman. Those beliefs are consistent with mainstream Christian beliefs.\nBooker announced on Facebook late Friday that he will vote against Pompeo, saying that the former congressman’s religious beliefs on these issues make him unfit to serve in federal office representing the United States. “I believe you can’t lead the people if you don’t love the people,” Booker wrote. The senator then Quote: : s Bible verses that he thinks Pompeo is not living up to, including references to loving his neighbor.\nArticle VI of the U.S. Constitution provides, “No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office of public Trust under the United States.”\nConservative and Christian leaders are appalled at Booker’s announcement, saying the Constitution forbids Booker’s voting against Pompeo because of the nominee’s religious beliefs.\n“Demanding a loyalty oath to Sen. Booker’s determination of which beliefs are acceptable isn’t what this country is about; indeed, it’s what we fought for independence from,” Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council (FRC), tells Breitbart News. “We should celebrate that we are a nation that not only allows but encourages every American to hold and express their beliefs – including their religious beliefs – without fear of retribution by the government.”\nPerkins, whose FRC has launched a petition protesting Booker’s violation of the Religious Test Clause that has 25,000 signatures at the time this article was filed, adds that this principle “is the essence of America and the Constitution.”\n“Religious bigotry and discrimination is unacceptable in this country, much less from someone who takes an oath to our Constitution and who is supposed to serve the people of this country,” agrees Kelly Shackelford, president of First Liberty Institute, in an exclusive comment to Breitbart News.\n“Sen. Cory Booker questioned Secretary of State-nominee Mike Pompeo for comments he made at his church, comments which reflected long-standing church doctrine regarding homosexual conduct and the biblical definition of marriage,” said Prof. John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage (NOM). “And now Sen. Booker asserts that he will oppose Pompeo for those views.”\n“This is essentially imposing a religious test on officers of the United States, something explicitly forbidden by Article VI of the Constitution,” added Eastman, whose NOM has likewise launched a petition.\n“The American people put President Trump in the White House in part because they refuse to be discriminated against for their long-held, mainstream beliefs,” Trump Transition Team leader Ken Blackwell offers to Breitbart News. “Whether on abortion, marriage, the Bible, the Second Amendment, or other issues, tens of millions of Americans who are wonderful people have been vilified for their beliefs by left-wing elites, and the American people chose a president who will stand up for them.”\nPompeo’s nomination is still pending in the Senate, with committee approval expected shortly but no final floor vote yet scheduled.\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Title : "Charlie Baker to sign off on sweeping criminal justice bill"

" Craig F. Walker/Globe Staff Governor Charlie Baker. By Matt Stout Globe Correspondent April 13, 2018\nGovernor Charlie Baker on Friday signed into law a sweeping overhaul to the state’s criminal justice system despite having “serious concerns” with some of its provisions, including a controversial change that would forbid parents from testifying against their minor children.\nFlanked by dozens of lawmakers and elected officials during a packed bill-signing ceremony, Baker hailed the law as a step forward for the state’s criminal justice system.\n“The law will undoubtedly result in a better criminal justice system and give people across the Commonwealth greater opportunities to turn their lives around,” Baker said.\nAdvertisement But he also immediately filed a bill calling for several revisions, including committing $15 million in the final months of this fiscal year to fund new staff and technology that he said are crucial to meeting its mandates. In a letter sent Friday to lawmakers, he warned that some parts of the law he signed could have “unintended, negative consequences.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here It’s unclear how the Legislature will tackle Baker's requests, with a host of other priorities still ahead, and after lawmakers have already spent months, if not years, completing the criminal justice package he penned into law Friday.\nBaker said he’s hopeful that, after speaking with lawmakers, they believe his proposals “deserve a good look.” But he stressed they also weren’t enough to derail the bill as a whole.\n“In the grand scheme of things, the very positive elements of this bill far outweigh some of the concerns we have,” Baker said.\nNotably, Baker flagged a controversial section of the bill that would forbid parents from testifying against their minor children. A mother who saw her 17-year-old son kill people, for example, couldn’t testify in court against him even if she wanted to, with the only exception being when the victim is a family member and resides in the household.\nAdvertisement Baker instead is proposing shifting the ban on testimony into a “privilege that can be exercised by a parent or child.”\n“If they don’t want to testify, they don’t have to,” he said.\nBut Senator William N. Brownsberger, a Belmont Democrat and coauthor of the legislation, said it’s a nonstarter, even though he views many of Baker’s other proposals “as clarifications, technical fixes” that could be taken up quickly.\n“It’s an issue that the body has voted on, taken a position on. It’s a done deal, for now,” Brownsberger said. “It’s not a technical fix. It’s something that other people feel strongly about.”\nBaker has suggested a range of other changes, including new language that would allow police, the Department of Early Education and Care, and other agencies to keep their access to certain records amid changes aimed at strengthening laws that seal records and expunge old convictions.\nAdvertisement Baker also argued that some aspects of the law place “unnecessary burdens” on the state’s Department of Correction, and is seeking to more narrowly define what’s considered a “serious mental illness” when deciding to put an inmate into solitary confinement.\nHouse Speaker Robert A. DeLeo on Friday was noncommittal when asked whether Baker’s changes would be fast-tracked, with the end of the session looming in July. He said the House has also begun factoring in costs from the new law into the budget proposal it unveiled this week .\n“The Governor has raised some points, and I think obviously it will get a proper hearing. Where we go from there, I don’t know,” the Winthrop Democrat said.\nBaker, who had until Sunday to take action on the bill, said he sought the separate bill to make changes because he didn’t want to delay putting the entire law and its “100 separate elements” into effect.\nBaker on Friday also signed a separate bill approved by lawmakers last week, crafted to give many prisoners a greater opportunity to earn early release through participating in and completing rehabilitative programming.\nThe criminal justice overhaul is part of a national movement to ease punitive “tough-on-crime” measures crafted in the 1980s and ’90s, which critics say have disproportionately affected poor people and people of color.\nIt would explicitly authorize district attorneys to divert people away from criminal sanctions. It would narrow the mandatory minimum sentence for dealing drugs in a school zone so that it applies only when a dealer has a gun, is selling to minors, or in certain other circumstances. And it would repeal other mandatory minimums, including the one-year sentence for the first offense of dealing cocaine.\nIt would also shift how the state handles some children who break the law.\nThe legislation would remove juvenile court jurisdiction over children aged 7 through 11 years old, so children that age would no longer face any criminal sanctions, even for murder. For example, in the extremely rare instance of an 11-year-old shooting someone, he or she could not be charged in court. But the Department of Children and Families could still get involved.\nIts signing drew dozens of advocates, lawmakers, and law enforcement officials to the State House for the ceremony, which took on a celebratory air before Baker signed it.\n“This is a landmark law,” said Attorney General Maura Healey. “This is about putting justice in our criminal justice system.”\nJoshua Miller of Globe staff contributed to this report.

"Donald Trump attacks James Comey's FBI memoir of 'lies' 15 April 2018   Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump called Mr Comey a \"slippery slimeball\" and the \"worst FBI director in history\" US President Donald Trump has attacked former FBI director James Comey over his \"many lies\", suggesting he be jailed over his testimony to Congress. \n\"Why did he lie to Congress (jail),\" Mr Trump said, adding: \"How come he gave up classified information (jail).\" \nHe also criticised Mr Comey's forthcoming memoir, saying the \"badly reviewed book\" raises \"big questions\". \nHis comments come ahead of an ABC News interview with Mr Comey to be aired on Sunday as part of his book tour. \nThe book - A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership - reportedly paints an unflattering portrait of Mr Trump, who fired Mr Comey last year. Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more? Report End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump \nAccording to excerpts of the book obtained by US media, Mr Comey writes that interactions with Mr Trump gave him \"flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob. The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview\". Comey's FBI memoir: Six claims about Trump \nIn the ABC News interview to be broadcast in full later on Sunday, Mr Comey discusses his handling of the FBI investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state under then-President Barack Obama. \nHe states that his assumption that Mrs Clinton would win the 2016 presidential election was a factor in opening the inquiry. \nMr Trump said this decision was \"stupid\" in a series of tweets on Sunday in which he referred to Mr Comey as \"slippery\" and a \"slimeball\". Skip Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball! Report End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump \nHe also said that the former FBI boss was \"not smart\" and \"will go down as the worst FBI director in history - by far!\", adding that his book was \"self-serving and FAKE!\". \nThe excerpts from Mr Comey's memoir have infuriated the US president, who insisted that he \"never asked Comey for personal loyalty\" and the he \"hardly even knew this guy\"."

"President Donald Trump 's personal attorney Michael Cohen has been under criminal investigation for months, largely centering around his business dealings, federal prosecutors in New York said in court documents obtained by ABC News. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Donald Trump Add Interest Today, prosecutors acknowledged publicly for the first time Friday that they seized records this week from Cohen.\nThe revelation came as Cohen and Trump sought a court order barring federal prosecutors from accessing the records they took during raids on his home and office Monday morning.\nLawyers for Cohen and Trump, neither of whom was present in court, argue that at least some of the records are subject to attorney-client privilege and should not be viewed by prosecutors until they, or an independent third party appointed by the court, have a chance to review the material.\nIn raid on Trump lawyer, feds sought records from deals with women, media and campaign: Sources\n'Start Here' podcast: We called Cohen\nTrump-appointed US attorney recused from Michael Cohen investigation\nCohen \"applied [Thursday] evening for an opportunity to take the first cut\" at determining whether the documents are privileged or relevant to the investigation, Judge Kimba Wood said. \"Both parties recognize the search of an attorney's devices and offices are subject to special consideration.\"\nJeenah Moon/Reuters\nMichael Cohen's attorneys Joseph Evans and Todd Harrison are pictured outside the Manhattan Federal Court in New York, April 13, 2018.\nA hearing Friday in Manhattan federal court was put on hold until Monday after an attorney for Trump intervened and requested additional time.\n\"He as an acute interest in these proceedings,\" said Joanna Hendon, an attorney for the president who said she was hired Wednesday night.\nHendon noted the \"exceptional nature\" of her client and expressed concern about the prosecutors' internal \"taint team\" that separates evidence that is privileged from evidence that is available for prosecutors to view.\n\"We don't need to rush,\" Hendon said. \"There is an appearance of fairness problem.\"\nA taint team is a group of people who help determine what falls under attorney-client privilege and should not be shared with investigators. It's standard when searching a lawyer's office.\n“The government’s use of a filter team appropriately protects applicable privileges,\" the court documents obtained by ABC News state.\nMonday’s search was broader than previously reported: in addition to Cohen's home and office, there were court-authorized searches of a safety deposit box and two cellphones.\nCohen “is being investigated for criminal conduct that largely centers on his personal business dealings,” according to court documents.\nThe federal prosecutor’s office “has already obtained search warrants -- covert until this point -- on multiple different email accounts maintained by Cohen, and has conducted a privilege review of the materials obtained pursuant to those warrants,” the court documents state.\nThat review, prosecutors said, showed that Cohen \"is in fact performing little to no legal work and that zero emails were exchanged with President Trump.\"\nCohen has not been charged with anything. He has not responded to news he is under investigation, declining to comment when contacted by ABC News.\nJustin Lane/EPA via Shutterstock\nAttorney Michael Cohen walks from his hotel to his apartment in New York, April 12, 2018.\nThomas McKay, one of the prosecutors handling the case, said the president's attorney-client privileges are no different than anyone else's. He accused the president and Cohen of delay tactics but promised prosecutors would not view any of the seized material until the judge makes her ruling following the hearing on Monday.\nAlso at issue was how much of this dispute will happen in open court. News organizations objected to parts of the hearing -- originally scheduled without notice -- taking place outside of public earshot.\n“I don’t take this position lightly,” said Wood.\nRachel Strom, an attorney for ABC News, successfully argued to keep most of the hearing open to the public.\n\"This is the most important hearing that’s happening today and the public has a right to know how the court is going to handle the search of the president’s lawyer’s documents,\" Strom said.\n Trump lawyer Michael Cohen under criminal investigation "

"Tax Day! Donald Trump Celebrates Death of Old System AP/Alex Brandon by Charlie Spiering 17 Apr 2018 0 \n17 Apr, 2018 17 Apr, 2018 President Donald Trump celebrated the end of the old system of filing taxes on Tax Day and touted the benefits of reform. “So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “Everyone is talking, really nice to see! Employment is up, Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!”\nOn Monday, the president hosted an event with Hispanic business leaders in Florida, who explained how the tax bill was already helping them.\n“This is the last time you’re going to fill up that long, complicated, horrible return,” Trump told the audience.\nHe pointed out that in 2019, filing taxes would be easier, as most people would be able to file a one-page tax return.\n“Very importantly, you’re going to have a lot of money left over from what you have,” Trump said.\nThe president reminded the audience that lower taxes for businesses would help bring more companies back into the United States to help produce more jobs.\n“Companies are moving back into our country now,” Trump said. “We have billions of dollars, and even trillions of dollars, going to be coming back in.”\nSo many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill.

Title : "Donald Trump considering pardon for boxer Jack Johnson - CNNPolitics"

"(CNN) President Donald Trump said Saturday that he is considering granting a posthumous pardon to boxer Jack Johnson on the advice of actor Sylvester Stallone.\n\"Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial,\" Trump tweeted. \"Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!\" Johnson, the first African-American world heavyweight boxing champion, was convicted in 1913 under the Mann Act for taking his white girlfriend across state lines for \"immoral\" purposes. The Mann Act purported to prevent human trafficking for the purpose of prostitution, but critics have argued it was applied inconsistently to criminalize African Americans and those with dissenting political views. Johnson was convicted by an all-white jury in less than two hours and was imprisoned for a year. The sentence and imprisonment destroyed the boxing career of the \"Galveston Giant.\" He died in 1946. In 2016, then-Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. John McCain , along with Reps. Peter King and Gregory Meeks, petitioned the Obama administration to grant a pardon to Johnson. The bipartisan group of lawmakers sent a letter to the White House asking that the pardon be given in honor of the 70th anniversary of the boxer's death. Read More \"While it is unfortunate that this unjust conviction was not corrected during the boxer's lifetime, a posthumous pardon today represents the opportunity to reaffirm Jack Johnson's substantial contributions to our society and right this historical wrong,\" the letter said. In March 2017, Sen. Cory Booker joined with McCain, King and Meeks to reintroduce a resolution urging Johnson's pardon. \"Despite this resolution passing both chambers of Congress several times in recent years, no pardon has been issued to date,\" McCain said in a statement at the time. \"I hope President Trump will seize the opportunity before him to right this historical wrong and restore a great athlete's legacy.\" The White House did not immediately return CNN's request for further comment on the President's tweet."

Title : "So we’re just going to ignore that an ex-Bill Clinton staffer interviewed James Comey on the Hillary Clinton email scandal?"

"Why does ABC News entrust its coverage of Hillary Clinton stories to one of the former first family’s longtime capos?\nGeorge Stephanopoulos, who served for years as an adviser to former President Bill Clinton, can sit across from former FBI director James Comey and say things like, “Your critics say this is a clear, clear, clear double standard. You revealed information about Hillary Clinton. You concealed information about Donald Trump. That elected Donald Trump,” and “you've decided to say publicly there is a criminal investigation — of Hillary Clinton, which many considered a break with precedent” and the press considers this scene to be perfectly normal.\nStephanopoulos, whom Clinton aides credited for using their work after the newsman had a particularly combative interview with Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer, can ask Comey, “do you think that the FBI would be in better shape today … if you had simply put out that one line statement, ‘We decline to prosecute’?” and “Can you assure people today — can you assure them that the Obama Justice Department was not protecting Hillary Clinton?” and this is ordinary.\nStephanopoulos, who as a news anchor used to partake in daily strategy calls with fellow Clinton White House alums James Carville and Paul Begala, can ask Comey questions like, “Your critics say you offered way too much information,” and “to Hillary Clinton supporters, that sounded like you're accusing her of a crime even though you don't prosecute,” and few — if any — in the press blink an eye.\nAfter all, Stephanopoulos, whose knee-jerk response to the Clinton email scandal was to say, “we'll also see if her critics overreact on this one,” is a “well-respected” member of the press; he’s “one of the biggest stars” on television.\nIf you think it’s strange that a former Clinton aide and Clinton Foundation donor should be assigned the task of interviewing Comey on the Clinton email scandal, you’re probably not alone. It's strange indeed that no one at his network seems to care."

Title : "Chelsea Clinton and the Democrats' Dullard Dynasty -"

"Fundamentals suggest that this should be a golden moment for the Democratic Party. The first special congressional elections since President Donald Trump settled into the Oval Office have provided an evidentiary taste: In Kansas on April 11, Republican Ron Estes won by seven percentage points in a district Trump carried by 27. In Georgia on April 18, Democratic newcomer Jon Ossoff stomped his nearest Republican rival, Karen Handel, 48.1–19.8 percent, in a district Trump won by a single percentage point. That race now graduates to a June 20 runoff, which is projected to be close, but Ossoff has already overperformed expectations.\nRELATED ARTICLES Chuck Schumer's Cannabis Conversion Illustrates Democrats' Shameful Hesitance Jacob Sullum | 4.20.18 \nDemocrats Sue Trump Campaign, Russian Government, and WikiLeaks Scott Shackford | 4.20.18 \nWill the Democrats Blow It in 2020?

If that number holds, it will mark the worst recorded January-to-June showing in the year before a midterm election for the party that controls the House of Representatives. Republicans previously polled at minus-four points in 2005 (a year before losing the House) and in 1997 (a year before Democrats gained five seats in a historic reversal of the presidential \"six-year itch\").\nWithin his first three months in office, Trump already surpassed the lowest-ever Gallup numbers of predecessors Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Gerald Ford, John F. Kennedy, and Dwight Eisenhower. At their 90-day marks, all presidents from Dwight Eisenhower onward had an average approval rating of at least 55 percent; Trump's was a sickly 41 percent.\nBut it's the nature of contemporary American politics to confuse the routine swing of the two-party pendulum with a historic shift in national sentiment. Amazon.com's subsection for books on politics is a graveyard of such premature end-zone dancing, from 2002's The Emerging Democratic Majority by John Judis and Ruy Teixeira, published just months before George W. Bush became the first-ever Republican president to see his party gain in both houses during a midterm, to Hugh Hewitt's Painting the Map Red: The Fight to Create a Permanent Republican Majority , which preceded the Democrats retaking Congress in 2006 for the first time in 12 years.\nThe donkeys may be picking themselves up off the mat, but don't confuse that for voter enthusiasm. Political self-identification as measured by Gallup was stuck down at 30 percent for Democrats (and 26 percent for Republicans) as of March; the party has failed to attract even one-third of Americans to its label for four long years now.\nWhy the reticence? For one of the main reasons, just consult any recent edition of The Hill . There, since the beginning of the year, the Washington, D.C., political newspaper has published scores of items noodling on the relentlessly banal musings of a person who has never held a job remotely near government: Chelsea Clinton.\nThere was \"Chelsea Clinton fuels speculation of political run,\" \"Chelsea Clinton plans new children's book,\" and—God help us—\"Chelsea Clinton knocks ObamaCare replacement plan.\"\nWhile providing the former first daughter generous helpings of airtime to promote her young adult rah-rah book It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going! , news anchors such as CBS' Gayle King have all but begged Clinton to run not just for elected office but for president . Like, three years from now. (\"I'm definitely not the right person to run to defeat [Trump] in 2020,\" Clinton replied. \"So right now, the answer is no.\")\nThis 100 percent top-down campaign to whip up enthusiasm for Clinton 3.0 reached a low point with a Los Angeles Times op-ed by Ann Friedman featuring the gag-me headline, \"Just like her mother, Chelsea Clinton never gets a break.\" Yes, the poor dear had to scratch and claw for every penny of the $600,000 annual NBC News salary she received to produce an estimated 58 minutes of programming between 2011 and 2014.\nLike former first lady Michelle Obama, whose name has also been whispered fervently by would-be queenmakers, Chelsea Clinton could exist as a hypothetical candidate only in a party that has run out of both ideas and talent. Surely there are more interesting politicians in this country of 320 million than rich, platitude-spewing amateurs with drearily famous last names.\nPhoto Credit: D Dipasupil/Getty"

Title : "Donald Trump is winning -- that's why the left is unraveling"

"By Cheryl K. Chumley - The Washington Times - Tuesday, April 17,   \nPresident Donald Trump rode into office on the wings, in part, of a promise to clean up the Deep State, drain the swamp and boot from places of influence those who’ve worked behind the scenes to undo America’s greatness, one unconstitutional usurpation at a time. \nIt must be working. How else to explain how nuts the left’s been acting of late? \nJust look at James Comey and his “A Higher Loyalty” book. In it, he paints Trump as a liar, a mafia-esque leader — a man of small hands, a president who’s brought the country to “a dangerous time,” to an era “where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded,” he wrote, according to published excerpts. \nBut peer past the words into the mind of the writer and it’s obvious: Here’s a guy who’s so ticked, who’s so pissed, who’s so filled with hate that he doesn’t even bother to filter. The rhetoric is unbefitting for a man of his supposed esteem — but apparently, he can’t help himself. \nThe tizzy doesn’t stop there. \nJohn Brennan, former Central Intelligence Agency director, unleashed similarly on his Twitter feed in recent times. \nIn one post, he wrote of Trump : “[Y]our self adoration is disgraceful.” In another, he predicted it wouldn’t be long before Trump ’s “venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption” became known — and then, the president would assume his “rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.” \nThat’s just a sampling of the vitriol. But again, unbefitting for a man of his supposed stature. \nLet’s not forget the over-the-top FBI hit job against Trump ’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the constitutionally questionable raid of his private offices and files. The raid wasn’t conducted directly by Robert Mueller’s special counsel office, but rather through the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. But it gives a hint of desperation just the same. The harsh tactics used here, described by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich as Gestapo-like, combined with the failure of Mueller’s yearlong investigation to produce anything of value that points a Russia collusion charge back to the president, suggest the raid was in large part a play to anti- Trump press bias. After all, what says guilt more than a dramatic federal raid? \nJust ask Paul Manafort, another victim of Gestapo-like early morning federal raid. \nAdd to this the bits and pieces of strange attacks on Trump ’s appointed people — like the one that went forth this week against Mike Pompeo, from Sen. Cory Booker, who couldn’t stop asking about the secretary of state nominee’s views of gay sex — and it’s becoming increasingly clear: The left is filled with fear. \nThe anti-Trumpers are shaking in their wearing thin, Trump -stomping boots. \nThe powers-who-be who’ve been aligning against Trump since his election days are realizing his impeachment is not imminent, his days are not numbered, his promises to untangle and unravel the Deep State are coming true. \nTruly, the left is losing it because Donald Trump is winning. \n• Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley. \n "

Title : "IVF law drafter slams new Bill as ‘chilling’"

"Sunday, April 15, 2018, 07:28 by Keith Micallef IVF law drafter slams new Bill as ‘chilling’ The proposed changes to the Embryo Protection Act come in for heavy criticism Among the proposed changes to IVF legislation, embryo freezing and adoption are arguably the most controversial. Photo: Shutterstock \nA medical professor who had been involved in the drafting of the existing IVF legislation has branded proposed changes to it as “chilling” and “irresponsible”. \nUniversity of Malta lecturer Prof. Pierre Schembri Wismayer gave this scathing review when asked for his reaction to the government’s plans from a medical perspective. \nIn 2012 he had been involved in the consultation held in the run-up to the drafting of the Embryo Protection Act which regulates IVF. \nHe summed up his assessment of the proposed changes as tantamount to a document prepared over the weekend by somebody high on energy drinks. \n“If such proposals were put forward in an exam paper, the candidate would have surely failed,” he said. \nAmong the proposed changes, embryo freezing and adoption are arguably the most controversial. \nProf. Schembri Wismayer noted that obliging couples who are interested in IVF treatment to give their consent to embryo adoption was probably a first. \n“It is as if they are being blackmailed to give away their own embryos for adoption in case these are not required.” \nAdoption, he said, might sound like a good compromise to avoid embryo destruction but in reality such a course of action would open a can of worms. Like a document prepared over the weekend by someone high on energy drinks \n“No couple will be interested in adopting an embryo. People are being deceived,” he said. \n“A gay couple would rather use their own egg or sperm to have half of the baby’s genetic composition rather than adopt an embryo belonging to third parties with no sense of belonging whatsoever,” he added. \nMoreover, he noted that embryologists would be selecting the “best two” embryos out of the permitted five for IVF treatment to have a higher probability of success. Pierre Schembri Wismayer \n“This means that the rest, which will be frozen, will in actual fact be less healthy embryos. This will further reduce the chance of these embryos being adopted.” \nRegardless, of these considerations, Prof. Schembri Wismayer warned that there would still be the risk of frozen embryos being destroyed, as statistically one in every three dies in the thawing process. \nThe expert also subscribed to concerns that embryo adoption opened up the possibility, albeit a remote one, of persons being in a relationship with their own siblings without their knowledge. \n“Much depends on the safeguards in place to ensure that the same person can only donate sperm or eggs once in their life. In this respect, the Bill says very little on the checks and balances which will be in place,” he says. \nAnother major concern raised was on the level of screening to be carried out on donors to detect certain hereditary diseases such as thalassemia, which is common in Malta. \n“At present tests are carried out on both partners if it transpires that one of them suffers from it, and if they both test positive, their children are highly likely to suffer as well. In this case such screening cannot be carried out since the donor’s identity will be anonymous. How will these diseases be screened? Will this result in genetic testing?” he questioned. \nThe Bill also says that when they turn 16, children born from an adopted embryo may check the medical records of the parents in case of serious diseases. \n“How will they be able to do so if the records will be kept anonymous?” he asked again. \nOn the other hand, he argued that banning anonymous donors might then pose the problem of putting off anyone interest in donating their sperm or eggs. \nThere are also issues over surrogacy in cases where children are born with certain conditions like Downs’ Syndrome. Prof. Schembri Wismayer warns that there have been cases abroad where the prospective parents have refused them. \n“Yet, it is being proposed to introduce surrogacy through a legal notice, not even a proper legislation,” he noted. \n“IVF is being handled in the most irresponsible manner. This is not some controversy over fuel pump policy. We are dealing with human life here. The very idea of enacting such a law in just a fortnight is chilling. It beggars belief that such a Bill has been presented in the first place to legislators,” he said. « Man hit by car in Floriana Transport Malta has long recognised trees as road hazards - but did it act? » Advert \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

"Robert De Niro Gives Donald Trump Another Savage Nickname Lee Moran Robert De Niro let loose again with some fierce criticism of President Donald More Robert De Niro let loose again with some fierce criticism of President Donald Trump . The two-time Oscar-winner used Wednesday’s press preview of the 17th annual Tribeca Film Festival in New York to take aim at Trump — and he bestowed another insulting new nickname on the president. “ The country has had a bad year and you, the press, have taken a lot of hits,” De Niro told reporters covering the event, per Deadline. De Niro said America was “being run by a madman who wouldn’t recognize the truth if it came inside a bucket of his beloved Colonel Sanders Fried Chicken.” He dubbed Trump “our lowlife-in-chief.” De Niro portrayed special counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, to hilarious effect on “ Saturday Night Live ” last weekend. Check out the “SNL” clip here: On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Today,” De Niro joked about reprising the role for scenes “where I interrogate (Trump), then I arrest him, and then I escort him to jail.” De Niro, who cofounded the Tribeca festival with production partner Jane Rosenthal in 2002, urged people to “speak out” against Trump’s administration. “They have to speak out over and over and over and over again. This guy, this administration, is beyond belief. It has to stop,” he said. "

Mack, 35, pleaded not guilty at a brief hearing in federal court in Brooklyn before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak. File/Gus Ruelas, Reuters NEW YORK—New York actress Allison Mack was arrested Friday on charges that she recruited women into a secret society led by self-help guru Keith Raniere in which they were forced to have sex with Raniere and were branded with his initials.\nMack, known for her role in the WB Television series \"Smallville,\" was charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy in an indictment unsealed on Friday. Mack, 35, pleaded not guilty at a brief hearing in federal court in Brooklyn before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak.\nPollak declined to release Mack on bail, but said Mack might be released at a future hearing if she could offer \"significant property\" to secure her bail. A second hearing is scheduled for Monday.\nRaniere, 57, was arrested last month and charged with sex trafficking. He is being held without bail.\n\"The allegations contained in the indictment are only that, allegations,\" Sean Buckley, a lawyer for Mack', said at Friday's hearing. He declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.\nU.S. authorities have accused Mack of recruiting women to join what purported to be a female mentorship group but was actually a secret society run by Raniere, the leader of a network of purported self-help groups based in Albany, New York, called Nxivm.\nProsecutors said women recruited into his secret society, who numbered as many as 50, were branded with Raniere's initials, put on extremely restrictive diets to stay thin and forced to have sex with Raniere.\nUpon joining, they were required to provide information about family and friends, nude photographs and rights to their assets - so-called collateral used to threaten them if they left, prosecutors said.\nThe women were taught that the society would empower and strengthen them, according to prosecutors.\nMack helped Raniere control the women in exchange for financial and other benefits from him, prosecutors said.\n\"Under the guise of female empowerment, she starved women until they fit her co-defendant's sexual ideal, and she targeted vulnerable women,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Moira Kim Penza said at Friday's hearing.\nOn its website, Nxivm calls itself \"a community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human.\"\nIn a letter on the site, Raniere said he was \"deeply saddened\" and denied \"abusing, coercing or harming\" anyone.\nMarc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Raniere, said earlier this month that he was \"confident these allegations will be soundly disproven.\" (Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York Editing by Leslie Adler)\nShare\nSave Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus"

Title : "The remarkable irresponsibility of Donald Trump's Stormy Daniels tweet - CNNPolitics"

"(CNN) On Wednesday morning, Donald Trump sent a tweet raising questions about the sketch of a man who allegedly harassed a porn star to keep her from talking about a sexual encounter with the current President of the United States aka Donald Trump.\nWhew. Go back and read that sentence again. Maybe read it twice more. It's yet another example of Trump's willingness to bust through not only what's considered normal and appropriate behavior for a president but also what's considered normal and appropriate behavior for anyone. In response to a tweet from a Twitter handle known as \"DeplorablyScottish\" which showed side-by-side images of the sketch Stormy Daniels produced of her alleged harasser and a picture of Daniels and a man who is purportedly her ex-boyfriend, Trump tweeted this: \"A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!\" Read More A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)! https://t.co/9Is7mHBFda \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2018 So. The President of the United States is alleging that Daniels -- who has said she and Trump were intimate in the mid 2000s -- is making up her story that she was approached by a man in 2011 who threatened her and her young daughter if she continued to talk about her time with Trump. Here's the thing: There's no doubt that Daniels' unveiling of the sketch, which she and her ever-present lawyer Michael Avenatti did in an appearance on \"The View\" Tuesday afternoon, was a publicity stunt. This is a sketch based on a 2011 encounter. While Avenatti told CNN's Jake Tapper that he has a sense of who the man is -- and that the person may be \"indirectly\" tied to Trump -- it seems unlikely that this sketch is what proves or disproves Daniels' broader allegations. That said! How could Trump possibly know whether or not a man harassed Daniels in 2011? Was he in the parking lot in which the alleged incident happened? If not, there is no possible way he could possess factual proof that Daniels is making up this story. Given that he lacks that proof, Trump on Twitter is simply using his massive bullhorn -- 51 million people strong -- to suggest that a woman is making up a story about being harassed. Which is remarkable. Of course, for Trump, anything and everything related to Daniels is tied up in her allegation that the two had sex in the mid 2000s -- a charge he has denied. (Worth noting: Trump attorney/fixer Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to keep her from telling the story of her alleged affair with Trump during the heat of the 2016 campaign.) But, that context shouldn't excuse what Trump is doing here. He is using his massive social media platform to discredit a woman alleging she was harassed. He is doing so entirely without proof that her allegation is false. (If Trump has proof Daniels is lying, he should come forward with it immediately.) That's the sort of behavior that in the past we would have condemned out of hand. Now, and with the President of the United States doing it, people accept it as a matter of course. They -- and we -- shouldn't."

Title : "Stormy Daniels Trolls Donald Trump and Michael Cohen | Vanity Fair"

"Big Trolls Stormy Daniels Trolls Donald Trump and Michael Cohen The adult-film actress who says she slept with the president pledges to donate $130,000 to Planned Parenthood in Trump’s lawyer’s name. by Stormy Daniels and attorney Michael Avenatti speak to the media outside the United States District Court Southern District of New York, April 16, 2018. By Drew Angerer/Getty Images. Tired: trolling to provoke anger and hatred. Wired: righteous trolling! In a new interview with Penthouse magazine, Stormy Daniels said that should she win the defamation case she has levied against President Donald Trump and his shrieking fixer Michael Cohen, she’ll donate $130,000 to Planned Parenthood—the exact amount she was reportedly paid by Cohen to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. The idea was likely inspired by a wave of donations that appeared after the election. By December 8, 2016, Planned Parenthood had collected 82,000 donations in the name of Mike Pence, a man who puts the con in a conservative approach to sexual health. The Vice President received thank-you notes for every donation, and presumably so would Trump and Cohen. Dawn Laguens, the health-care provider’s executive V.P., told Vanity Fair that Daniels “joins more than 11 million Americans who support Planned Parenthood. We’re glad to see Ms. Daniels recognize the importance of access to reproductive health care, even if the Trump-Pence administration does not.” Michael Avenatti, who has a forehead I would trust with my life and is Daniels’s attorney, has also offered the same amount, plus $1,000, to anyone with information regarding the person who allegedly approached Daniels in a parking lot and told her to “leave Trump alone.” The adult-film actress said the anonymous man referred to her daughter and added, “That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.” (The Daniels’s team released a sketch of the man , which Trump has called “a total con job.” ) Elsewhere on Daniels’s media tour, she appeared on The View Tuesday morning , where she faced the group’s lone Republican panelist, Meghan McCain, who questioned all the publicity Daniels has received since coming forward with a story about the alleged affair with Trump, and the subsequent payout from Cohen. (Cohen has admitted exchanging $130,000 for her silence, but maintains that it was his money and Trump was none the wiser.) “Can I just say, first of all, I did not name the tour,” she said about the so-called “Make America Horny Again” strip-club tour, which McCain specifically referenced. “You won’t hear me say it. I haven’t promoted that name. I think it’s awful.” “As far as the tour, yes, I’ve gotten more bookings than usual but I’m doing the job that I’ve been doing for the last almost 20 years,” Daniels added. “Yes, there’s a lot of publicity, but I didn’t do it for that because this isn’t what I want to be known for. I hid from it for a while because it’s overwhelming and intimidating and downright scary a lot of times. I’ve had to hire bodyguards. Yes, I’m making more money, but I’m spending so much more.” Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. And it's on the house.

Title : "At Sylvester Stallone's urging, Trump weighs 'full pardon' for boxer Jack Johnson"

"Email \nPresident Trump said he is considering a pardon for boxer Jack Johnson. (AP) President Trump Saturday said that he is considering a “full pardon” for boxing’s first black heavyweight champion, Jack Johnson, after being urged to do so by “Rocky” actor Sylvester Stallone. Trump said that Stallone had called him and told him about Johnson, and that he is now considering a posthumous pardon. Stallone is a Trump supporter and attended his New Years' Eve Party in 2016, according to The Associated Press. \n“[Johnson's] trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial,” Trump tweeted. “Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!” Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2018 \nJohnson, born in Galveston, Texas, was the target of racial resentment, particularly after he defeated white boxer James Jeffries in the 1910 “Fight of the Century,” a bout that sparked race riots. Three years later he was convicted by an all-white jury of violating the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport a woman across state lines for “immoral” purposes. \nIn their efforts to prosecute Johnson, authorities first targeted Johnson's relationship with the woman in question, Lucille Cameron, who later became his wife, but she refused to cooperate. \nBut they found another white witness, Belle Schreiber, to testify against him. Johnson fled the country after his conviction, but he agreed years later to return and serve a 10-month jail sentence. He died in 1946. \nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been calling for a pardon for Johnson since 2004, and criticized President Obama for leaving office in 2017 without having granted one. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., had also called for a pardon. \n“Johnson’s imprisonment forced him into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice, and continues to stand as a shameful stain on our nation’s history,” McCain said in a statement in January 2017. \nTrump is considering a pardon for boxer Jack Johnson. (AP) \nJohnson’s great-great niece has also pressed Trump for a pardon. \nPosthumous pardons are rare, but not unprecedented. President Bill Clinton pardoned Henry O. Flipper, the first African-American officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry Regiment during the Civil War; he was framed for embezzlement. Bush pardoned Charles Winters in 2008, an American volunteer in the Arab-Israeli War convicted of violating the U.S. Neutrality Acts in 1949. \nFox News’ Ben Florance and The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.
