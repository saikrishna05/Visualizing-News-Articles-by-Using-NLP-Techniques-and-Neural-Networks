"Jennifer Hart was drunk when she drove family off California cliff in deadly crash Jennifer Hart was drunk when she drove family off cliff Jennifer Hart (l) and Sarah Hart (r), along with their three adopted children, were found dead after their car plunged off a coastal cliff in California late last month. (Thomas Boyd/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Friday, April 13, 2018, 5:44 PM \nA California mother was drunk when she drove a vehicle carrying her wife and children off a cliff in a deadly crash last month. \nJennifer Hart's blood alcohol content was 0.102, according to California Patrol Capt. Bruce Carpenter. Drivers are considered impaired if they have a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or higher in California. \nHer wife, Sarah Hart, and two of the couple's six children had \"a significant amount\" of an ingredient found in allergy medication Benadryl, which can result in drowsiness, in their systems, according to toxicology tests. \nNeither Hart nor her passengers were wearing seatbelts, Carpenter said. \nCPS asked authorities to check on Hart kids hours before crash \nThe same-sex couple and their six adopted children were all believed to be in the vehicle when it veered off course last month. \nJennifer, Sarah, and three of their children were confirmed dead in the coastal cliff crash. Two kids' bodies are missing and a third body has been found but wasn't identified. \nThe couple's former foster child, identified only as Lee, reflected on the troubling period she spent with them. One memory in particular stands out to her: Her one-time guardians abandoned her at a therapy appointment, turning her over to a new family without as much as a good-bye, according to the Seattle Times . \nAuthorities said the pair could have driven off the cliff on purpose, killing the entire family. California Highway Patrol officers and deputy sheriffs from Mendocino and Alameda counties gather after a search for three missing children. (Alvin Jornada/AP) \n“I don’t believe Jen and Sarah to be evil people, and I don’t want to believe that they killed their family intentionally,” their former foster child told the Times. \nLee, who acknowledged being a difficult child, spent her teenage years in and out of foster care. \nRecurring behavioral issues left her single mother overwhelmed and in the summer of 2004, Lee wound up at the Harts' Minnesota home. The women had recently graduated from Northern State University in South Dakota, where they were originally from. \nLee said the first several months with the couple had been “really good.” She recalled camping trips and amusement park excursions with her guardians. But she soon found herself at odds with Jennifer, whom she referred to as the more moody of her two parents. \nGrainy vid could be clue in Washington family's SUV death plunge \nShe cited a trip to Lambeau Field, all three of them carrying footballs, in hopes of nabbing an autograph from running back Ahman Green. \nBut when the football star opted to sign the teen’s ball, “it turned into a huge fiasco,” Lee recalled. Jennifer accused of her being “a brat” and then ignored her for days. \nDespite mounting tension, Lee intended to remain with the Harts until she turned 18. The family of three even discussed the arrangement with officials. Authorities investigating at the home of Jennifer, Sarah and their six children. (Jim Ryan/AP) \nAround the same time, the Harts were gearing up to adopt other children. The couple discussed the responsibilities of being a big sister with Lee, who was excited to take on the role. \nAuthorities believe California cliff crash was 'intentional' \nA week before her new siblings were expected to arrive, the Harts dropped Lee off at a therapy appointment and never returned. Her therapist explained she would be living with a new family — all of her belongings had already been removed from the Hart family home. \n“I remember being devastated,” Lee said. \nThere have been countless abuse allegations raised against the couple, including a 2011 misdemeanor assault conviction for Sarah. \nNearly four months before the fatal crash, a neighbor phoned 911 to report an episode in which one of the couple's children desperately sought help, CNN reported. \n“The other night, a little girl jumped out of the second-story window on the roof and then down to the ground and then ran to my daughter and, this is like two in the morning, begging them to help her,” he told dispatchers. \nShe told them she was being whipped with belts and that “her moms were racist and were abusing her.” \nNeighbor Bruce DeKalb also offered a disturbing account of the Hart family, claiming 16-year-old Devonte Hart, who remains missing, would turn up at their home asking for food in the weeks leading up to the crash.

Title : "‘I Was Trump Before Trump Was Trump’ - The New York Times"

"Supported by ‘I Was Trump Before Trump Was Trump’ Republican candidates all over are parroting the president, spouting his catchphrases and donning his hats as they try to show loyalty. April 22, 2018 Video As the midterm elections approach, some Republican candidates are not only embracing President Trump’s policies but also his tone and catchphrases. Published On April 22, 2018 Don Blankenship likes to believe he knows something about rough justice and who deserves it. “We don’t need to investigate our president. We need to arrest Hillary,” one of his campaign ads proclaims, mimicking President Trump’s crude 2016 rallying cry, “Lock her up!” Mr. Blankenship, who has a respectable chance of winning the Republican nomination for Senate in West Virginia on May 8, is, in more ways than one, the ideal candidate for the Trump era. He spent a year in prison on charges rising from the collapse of one of his coal mines, which killed 29 people. Mr. Blankenship nurses a deep sense of grievance, and he has no political experience to speak of. But he does have a natural inclination for one of the most distinctive and defining contributions that Mr. Trump has made to American politics: its sound. In Republican races across the country, candidates like Mr. Blankenship are parroting the president as they try to prove to voters that they are cut from the same cloth as he is. They recite the Trump lexicon, spouting his trademark phrases and slurs like “Drain the swamp,” “Build the wall,” “rigged system,” “fake news” and “America first.” They are channeling Mr. Trump’s belligerent and profane style of speaking, seeking to capture that essential but elusive quality that matters so much to voters these days — authenticity. And they wear his hats. In Indiana, Representative Todd Rokita, a Republican candidate for Senate, proudly slaps on a red “Make America Great Again” cap in a new ad as he promises to “proudly stand with our president and Mike Pence to drain the swamp.” Not to be outdone, one of Mr. Rokita’s opponents, Luke Messer, tarred Mr. Rokita as “Lyin’ Todd,” an echo of Mr. Trump’s epithet for Senator Ted Cruz, “Lyin’ Ted.” Mr. Messer’s gripe? Mr. Rokita falsely claimed to have received the president’s endorsement. Image Representative Todd Rokita, a Republican candidate for Senate in Indiana, falsely claimed to have received the president's endorsement. Credit Michael Conroy/Associated Press Representative Martha McSally, a Republican who is running for the Arizona Senate seat of Republican Jeff Flake, who is retiring, offers a testimonial in one of her campaign videos from Mr. Trump about how “tough” and “real” she is. She tells a story about how she once told Washington politicians to “grow a pair of ovaries.” As further proof of her saltiness, Ms. McSally offers up an old, bleeped out quote from a news article. “McSally stood up,” the text onscreen reads, “and said let’s get this ‘@#$% thing’ done.” Marsha Blackburn, a congresswoman from Tennessee, wants it known that she will pick the same fights as the president. In an ad announcing her candidacy for the Senate seat of Bob Corker — who also plans to retire — right after she mentions her skeet-shooting skills and the gun she packs in her purse, she promises to stand with Mr. Trump “every step of the way to build that wall.” “I stand when the president walks in the room. And yes, I stand when I hear ‘The Star-Spangled Banner,’” she adds, nodding to the president’s spat with the National Football League after some players knelt in protest during the national anthem. Mr. Trump has so thoroughly rewritten the rules of engagement in politics that restraint and polish have become signs of weakness for many candidates. No longer do they assume as they once did that a special set of rules applies to him, and that they would be punished for trying to mimic his behavior. “Today the goal is linguistic,” said Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who specializes in the words and messages that candidates use. “We are no longer rewarding policy; we are rewarding rhetoric.” “On a personal level,” Mr. Luntz added, “it sickens me.” Some Democrats have even begun to believe this strategy has its merits. The lofty approach of the Obamas — “ When they go low, we go high ” — may be unrealistic as long as Mr. Trump is leading the Republican Party. Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton, recently wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post that advised Democrats running against the president in 2020 to “swing at every pitch.” “Trump never says, ‘I’m not dignifying that with an answer,’” Mr. Reines went on. “He has no dignity. He leaves no attack unanswered. I spent 15 years recommending ignoring stupidity. ‘It has no legs. Don’t give it oxygen. There’s no pickup.’ I was wrong.” In an interview, Mr. Reines said he was embracing this only as a “desperate times calls for desperate action” tactic. But as he spent time lately reading up on the guerrilla strategies of World War II resistance groups, one thing became clear: “The bigger person will lose.” Some Democratic politicians seem to agree. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a former vice president, asserted last month that he would have taken Mr. Trump “behind the gym and beat the hell out of him” if they were both still in high school. Other Democrats like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey have displayed their aggressive side lately; Mr. Booker’s eruption at Kirsten Nielsen , the secretary of homeland security, at a recent hearing went viral. For some Republicans, it is not enough to merely talk like Mr. Trump or say they will fight with him. They want to take credit for his style. “Someone told me the other day that I was the first Trump, the Trump for Mississippi,” Chris McDaniel, a candidate for Senate in Mississippi, said recently . It doesn’t always work. Rick “ I was Trump before Trump was Trump ” Saccone was defeated by a Democrat in March in a special election in heavily Republican southwestern Pennsylvania. Corey Stewart, a failed candidate for governor of Virginia last year, also tried to tell voters, “I was Trump before Trump was Trump.” That all feels a long way from 2012, when Republican candidates and “super PACs” spent millions of dollars honing carefully calibrated attacks on President Barack Obama that would not be too harsh so as to alienate voters who still liked him but had doubts, and not too soft so as to lack a punch. “There used to be a sense that if you were that over the top, voters would punish you for it,” said Russ Schriefer, a Republican messaging expert who advised Mitt Romney and George W. Bush. “Now, it is less about who’s more conservative,” he added, “and more about who’s going to adhere to the Trump agenda and the Trump ideology.” Candidates now seem most comfortable talking about vanquishing their enemies than they do about governing. Josh Hawley, the Missouri attorney general who is running for Senate, has degrees from Yale and Stanford. He clerked for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Yet as he campaigns, he attacks “the political class” and “elites” on the coasts who see Missourians only as “empty squares out the window of a jet flying from New York to L.A.” In a recent speech , Mr. Hawley delivered one of Mr. Trump’s signature punch lines as he accused the “Hollywood and Wall Street and the D.C. political establishment” of working together “to rig a system that favors them.” Image Don Blankenship, a Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia, is just one candidate trying to prove to voters that he is cut from the same cloth as President Trump. Credit Spencer Platt/Getty Images Not everyone, of course, can channel Mr. Trump and be as convincing as Mr. Blankenship. From the moment he was released from prison last year, he started using Twitter to bludgeon his political opponents. He calls them liars and liberally employs exclamation points. He teases coming campaign announcements. One new ad cites statistics on crime committed by undocumented immigrants and notes that the estimated 12 million people in the United States illegally amount to “six times West Virginia’s entire population.” “Republican Don Blankenship,” the announcer assures viewers, “will vote for the wall.” \nJeremy W.

"In surprise, George H.W. Bush greets Barbara's mourners Share this — In surprise, George H.W. Bush greets Barbara's mourners The former president smiled and shook people's hands as they offered condolences. by Associated Press / / Updated Apr.20.2018 / 8:53 PM ET Former first lady Barbara Bush lies in repose at St. Martin's Episcopal Church on Friday in Houston. Richard Carson / Pool, via AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE \nHOUSTON — Former President George H.W. Bush surprisingly greeted some of the hundreds of mourners filing through a large Houston church on Friday as they paid final respects to his wife of 73 years, former first lady Barbara Bush . \nA spray of dozens of pink and yellow roses covered her closed, light-colored metallic casket in the sanctuary of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church. The 93-year-old former president sat in a wheelchair just a few feet from the casket, smiling as people shook his outstretched hand and offered condolences. \nBarbara Bush died Tuesday at age 92 at the couple’s Houston home, where her husband was also by her side. Many women attending the daylong viewing wore blue, Barbara Bush’s favorite color, and pearls, a nod to her go-to jewelry. \nThe nation’s 41st president hadn’t been scheduled to attend but decided to go after watching video from the church, where about 1,600 people had passed through in the first hour. He stayed for about 15 minutes. \n“I think he was very touched by all of the people who were taking the time out of their lives,” family spokesman Jim McGrath said.

Bush shakes mourners hands as Barbara Bush lies in repose 00:43 \nVisitors went through security checks before boarding shuttle buses to travel a few miles to the nation’s largest Episcopal church. Lucy Orlando was among more than 100 people in line well before bus service began, after traveling from Florida. Originally from Haiti, the 74-year-old said had admired Barbara Bush for years, including for her work promoting literacy. \n“She was a very sweet lady and she loves people,” said Orlando, who was carrying a gray suitcase containing framed photos of the couple and members of their family, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura. \nVarney Johnson, 49, a social worker originally from Liberia, said he also came to honor the former first lady’s work in supporting literacy efforts, saying: “This woman dedicated her life to educating children.” People gather in honor of former first lady Barbara Bush outside Houston City Hall on Thursday. Evan Vucci / AP \n“I believe that Barbara Bush is a mother and a grandmother to every American,” added Jamie Sumicek, 52, of Houston. “Whether you’re Democrat or whether you’re Republican, whether you’re young or old, she is the matriarch of America. That’s what moved me to visit.” \nA hearse containing the former first lady’s casket arrived before daybreak at the church. Her body was to be in repose until midnight. Among the officials allowed in earlier were the Senate’s majority whip, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. \nThe invitation-only funeral will be held Saturday behind her husband’s presidential library at Texas A&M University, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The burial site is in a gated plot surrounded by trees and near a creek where the couple’s 3-year-old daughter, Robin, who died of leukemia in 1953, is buried.

Baker III, and historian Jon Meacham, who wrote a 2015 biography of her husband. \nAbout 1,500 guests were expected to attend, including first lady Melania Trump, former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, and former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle.

Title : "Mock Indiana? Think again"

"News Opinion Commentary and Senate President John Cullerton couldn’t even agree on how much money is available to spend in the state’s upcoming budget year. They’re currently fighting about the starting point.\nI asked Indiana officials if they argue over revenue projections. They didn’t quite understand the question because, well, no they don’t squabble. State leaders from both parties spend a few weeks looking at forecasts and seeking outside advice. Then they come to an agreement on how much money is available to spend in the next budget cycle. Weird, right? \nI asked my friend Abdul-Hakim Shabazz, a political commentator, writer and attorney in Indianapolis who used to live in Illinois, for his thoughts on the two states. \nFor instance, teachers in Indiana are threatening to strike over low pay. But in Illinois, local taxes, which support public schools, are driving residents to move away from our state. Why are we so different? \n“The big difference is that when it was time to make hard choices and hard decisions, Indiana buckled down and made them,” he said. “Illinois kicked the can down the road. When all that pension stuff was starting to bubble up and nobody did anything in Illinois, we had (former) Gov. Mitch Daniels to make those hard decisions.” \nDaniels was elected in 2004, two years into Rod Blagojevich’s first term as governor. Instead of dealing responsibly with pension pressures, Blagojevich led a $10 billion borrowing scheme to make pension payments and then signed off on budgets with pension-payment holidays. But really, no Illinois governor, past or present, Democrat or Republican, has urgently dealt with this state’s pension crisis. \nShabazz grew up in Chicago, worked for Illinois state government for several years and still owns property in Springfield. He appreciates both states and even Illinois’ “knock-down, drag-out (political) culture that, if done well, rewards smartness and a certain amount of shrewdness.” \nThat is not the final product, however. The culture of shrewdness here is perverse and destructive. \nBefore we ended our conversation, Shabazz added this observation: “State government unions are not as powerful in Indiana as they are in Illinois. If I had to compare the two, I would say Illinois is an example of what happens when you let government unions get out of control.” \nSo what’s better: unions running state government or so-called hicks running state government? \nI think you know the answer. \nKristen McQueary is a member of the Tribune Editorial Board. \nkmcqeuary@chicagotribune.com"

The clear anti-immigration and border-wall references backfired in a major way for Salka, as Vargas proceeded to dominate the fight in a sixth-round referee technical decision.

Vargas said he took the shorts as extra motivation, via azcentral : \"I was surprised when (Salka) was coming to the ring. I saw him dressed with a wall on his clothes, or representing the wall, but I kept calm. I was focused on making my fight and on my plan,\" Vargas said in Spanish to ESPN Deportes. \"Once we were already in the ring, the wall was an extra ingredient (for my motivation to win), so when I had him head on, I gave it everything. Whatever it is I represent Mexico, and I feel that everything about that wall is against all my countrymen.\" And, of course, Salka was subjected to relentless Twitter roasting after his loss.

(Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) Buy Photo CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE INDIANAPOLIS – Bojan Bogdanovic was shooting it from 26 feet, then 28 feet, then 30. He was shooting with nobody near him and with J.R. Smith all over him and even with Kyle Korver crashing into him. He was shooting shots and quietly running back down the court, and then he was shooting shots and roaring in triumph, a postseason shooting display we’ve seen once before around here, from a guy everyone calls Reggie. And on Friday night in Game 3 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Indiana Pacers forward Bojan Bogdanovic was doing what Reggie Miller did back in that 1995 miracle against the New York Knicks: He was making every damn one of them. Bogdanovic scored 15 of his game-high 30 points in a 6½-minute stretch of the fourth quarter, turning this game around and the 2018 NBA playoffs on its head – leading the Pacers to a stunning 92-90 victory, giving them a 2-1 series edge and putting them halfway toward eliminating LeBron James in the first round of the NBA playoffs. More: LeBron couldn’t figure out the Pacers. He also couldn’t figure out this mic. Before we say another word about Bogdanovic, and I’ve got so much more to say about that guy, let’s give some credit way up high in this story to Thaddeus Young, who was obliterated in Game 2 by LeBron James’ 16-point onslaught to open the game – but rallied in Game 3. Bogdanovic broke this game wide open, but it was Young who made his heroics possible with back-to-back defensive stands against LeBron. The first one happened with 6:18 to play and the score tied at 77 and LeBron at midcourt with the ball, isolated with Young after a switch, looking at Young the way a lion might look at an antelope. But what’s this? The antelope is attacking the lion, Young coming to midcourt to meet LeBron, moving his feet and clawing at the ball and joined for a moment by Bogdanovic himself. At one point LeBron looked to the referee for help, but he was on his own – and two days after destroying Young in Game 3, LeBron found himself surrounded by one man, backed up by Young to the halfcourt stripe and trying not to fall over it and losing his balance and being called for traveling. CLOSE Bogdanovic key in Pacers win. Clark Wade/IndyStar LeBron was still gesturing angrily at the referee when Pacers guard Victor Oladipo attacked the rim, saw Bogdanovic on the right wing and threw him the ball. Bogey catches it and rises and Cavs guard Kyle Korver is closing out on him but a little late, inches short, and the ball is floating toward the rim, which it won’t touch on its way down, as Korver is banging into him. Four-point play. Four-point lead, the Pacers’ biggest to date. Oh, but it was about to get bigger. Because Thad Young was about to make another defensive play on LeBron, and on George Hill, and on the whole Cleveland offense. That’s how good Young’s defense was on the next Cavs possession, which began with LeBron sizing up Young –still the lion, still unimpressed with the antelope – and now the lion is charging and Young is moving his feet and staying in front of LeBron, all the way into the lane, where the lion realizes he can’t shake this antelope and so LeBron passes to George Hill. And Thaddeus Young, he just keeps moving his feet, coasting over to Hill on the baseline, harassing him now, forcing Hill to pass the ball and then just taking it from him. Five seconds later, Bogdanovic is alone in the corner for a 3-pointer that is pure, giving the Pacers an 84-77 lead. Buy Photo \nIndiana Pacers forward Thaddeus Young (21) knocks the ball away from Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) in the second half of game #3 of their NBA Eastern Conference playoff game on Friday April 20, 2018. The Indiana Pacers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 92-90. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) “That was amazing,” is how Pacers point guard Darren Collison was describing Bogdanovic’s fourth-quarter explosion. “He’s a great, great shooter.” Bogdanovic wasn’t done, of course. Have I described 15 points? I have not. Earlier he’d hit a wide-open 3-pointer, getting lost behind a Domantas Sabonis screen to draw the Pacers within 75-73. That was the closest they’d been to Cleveland since the first quarter, with the Pacers playing a mostly desultory offensive game and the Cavaliers building their lead to 57-40 at halftime and playing with a 10-point margin throughout the third quarter. But then Bogdanovic happened, and kept happening, and happened for the final time with 2:26 left. Bogey already had scored 12 points in about six minutes, but clearly it was time for a heat check, so he fired from 31 feet and made the damn thing and the crowd is going nuts in a happy way, in stark contrast to the fury with which it booed the referees off the court at halftime, and Bogdanovic is hooting and hollering in route to the Pacers bench because this is his moment and he knows it. After closing the season on the hottest prolonged streak of his career, averaging 16.5 ppg and shooting 45 percent on 3-pointers in the final 30 games, Bogdanovic was ineffective on offense in the series’ first two games: 11.5 ppg, 34.8 percent from the floor overall (8-for-23) and 22.2 percent on 3-pointers (2-for-9). But on Friday night he was 11-for-15 from the floor and 7-for-9 on 3-pointers, tying the franchise postseason record for 3-pointers set in 1991 by Chuck Person and tied twice by Reggie Miller (1995, 2000) and once by Paul George (2014). The Pacers needed every bit of Bogdanovic’s barrage, because after doing it to open Game 2, LeBron pulled another LeBron late in Game 3 – scoring 12 straight Cleveland points down the stretch, including back-to-back 3-pointers to answer the same from Bogdanovic, cutting the Pacers’ lead from 84-77 to 84-83. The second one had the Cavs bench giggling and the Pacers crowd groaning, because it was happening again, right? The Pacers are the better team, from top to bottom, but the Cavs have LeBron – and for years that’s been enough, as it was in Game 2 when LeBron scored 46 points to carry his dead-weight supporting cast to victory. A little later, when LeBron stubbed his sneaker and lost his balance and fell forward and flung another 3-pointer through the rim, Bankers Life Fieldhouse went completely silent. But soon it was screaming, because Darren Collison was making one free throw with five seconds left and fortunately missing the second, forcing the Cavs into one last, unscripted – and terrible – final shot: J.R. Smith’s 40-footer. The heave wasn't close, bouncing in the direction of Pacers owner Herb Simon and executive Donnie Walsh and the man sitting behind them, Larry Bird, who was watching a Pacers franchise that has caught up to the Cleveland Cavaliers, and is two games from leaving them in the rear-view mirror.

In what was considered to be a lopsided trade at the time, Oladipo has quickly changed the minds of any doubters of the trade following a career year with the Pacers. In a Players Tribune story published Monday morning, Oladipo talks about his feelings when he found out about the trade and the first person he texted other than his mom following the news of the trade. Doma was my next text. Had to be. Doma is Domantas Sabonis. That’s my guy. He was really the only person who was going to understand. We’d done this before. Doma was in the trade to the Pacers with me, but we’d also been together since pretty much the moment he got drafted by the Magic in 2016. We got traded together to OKC. Now to Indy. So I knew Doma wouldn’t want me to sugarcoat anything, but I had to check in with him — let him know what I was thinking. I texted him what I knew was true: I promise, if you win here in Indiana, they’ll embrace you like no other. I felt a little better right away. I called my mom back and told her everything was going to be all right. I really believed it, too. I couldn’t have told you exactly how it was gonna work out or how we’d get there, but I knew. I just knew. Because I knew that not every trade is the same, just like not every state is the same. And I knew this wasn’t just any trade. It was the Pacers. It was Indiana, and I knew Indiana. I wasn’t going to just another team. I was coming home. Indiana's prestige and history really attracted Oladipo but he had no idea what he was really getting into. I got to Bloomington, Indiana in 2010. Coming out of high school in Maryland, I chose Indiana because of the program’s history, but really I had no idea how serious people in Indiana took basketball. I think even right now very few people outside of Indiana recognize how much basketball means to the state. There’s a basketball hoop in every driveway. It’s all Hoosiers and Pacers flags. And a big high school game pretty much shuts an entire community down. And when you’re on the IU team, they know. Like, they really make a point to get to know you. Whenever he came back to Indiana while he was on other teams, fans acted like he was still playing for the Hoosiers. I can’t tell you how special it feels when you think about how in only a few years, you can go from nobody knowing how to pronounce your name, to 20,000 people chanting it in unison. And I was on the opposing team. It was like that every time I came back. If I was playing for Orlando, Oklahoma City, it didn’t matter. If I ever went out in Indiana I was embraced by the people. Everyone remembered the years I played in college and talked about them like I was still on the team. Even when I was away, I was tied to Indiana. Indiana may not be a vacationers dream destination and a flyover state on the map, but that motivates not only Oladipo but the residents of Indiana. Maybe you’ve never been to Indiana. Or maybe you’ve just visited once or twice. Never even really thought about it. It’s a flyover state, right? One that’s easy to glance over on a map. And I bet that when you heard about the Thunder-Pacers trade, you were thinking about Paul George. Doma and I — we were a package deal, traded for the second time in a year, going to a non-contender in a flyover state. We know what it feels like to be overlooked. And so do a lot of guys on our team. And a lot of people in our arena. We know what it feels like when somebody gives up on you. More Pacers:"

Title : "Rodent Infestation, ‘Spread of Filth’ Found Before Egg Recall"

"Before a U.S. farm voluntarily recalled 207 million eggs, government inspectors found rodents scurrying in manure pits, equipment that was coated with grime and food debris, and outside a swarm of “large flying insects too numerous to count.”\nUnsanitary conditions were found during multiple inspections of a Rose Acre Farms facility in Hyde County, North Carolina, that allowed for the “proliferation and spread of filth and pathogens throughout the facility that could cause the contamination of egg processing equipment and eggs,” according to a report from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detailing inspections. A review of the farm’s pest control records flagged an ongoing rodent infestation, with rodents, dead carcasses and baby mice observed, along with workers who weren’t following proper sanitary practices.\nThe farm voluntarily recalled the eggs earlier last week after more than 20 consumers became ill from a suspected salmonella poisoning. The recall is the largest of eggs in the U.S. since 2010, when more than 550 million were recalled from two Iowa farms, according to the website Food Safety News.\nThe FDA’s inspection report “is based on raw observations and in some cases lack proper context,” Gene Grabowski, an outside spokesman for Rose Acre Farms, said in an email. The company is preparing a formal response to the report and “until then, we would urge everyone to wait until all the facts are presented before rushing to judgment.”\n‘Debris and Grime’ Throughout a March 28 review, federal inspectors “observed condensation dripping from the ceiling, pipes and down walls onto production equipment” and pooling on floors, the FDA said. Employees were found in violation of proper sanitary procedures, and a steel wool scrubber used to clean debris off equipment was stored on a cart in a dustpan that had a pool of water “floating with debris and grime.”\nSalmonella Outbreak Forces Recall of 207 Million Eggs\nOn one visit, inspectors saw “at least 25 flying insects” in the egg processing facility landing on food, food production equipment and contact surfaces, according to the report.\nThe company voluntarily recalled the eggs after an investigation of illnesses on the East Coast triggered an inspection of the facility. The recall is equivalent to about 90 days of output at the farm, which produces 2.3 million eggs a day.\n Katherine Tam\n "

"Last Slide Next Slide Buy Photo Americans for America Indiana rally, a gun rights advocate organization, rallied at the Indiana State House on April 14, 2018. Organizers encouraged gun rights supporters to bring their unloaded rifles to the rally. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) Buy Photo CONNECT 13 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Gun rights supporters rallied in Indianapolis and state capitols across the country Saturday to emphasize their point of view in a debate further heightened by the Florida school shooting earlier this year and the national protests that followed. Their message at the Indiana Statehouse: They disagree with those who have called to repeal the Second Amendment and to limit their gun rights. To Saturday's participants, the right to bear arms isn't given by the Constitution but simply protected by it, said organizer Bill Slike III. \"We're sympathetic to the fears of ... the people who want to take guns away, who want to ban things, but when you look at the details of what the actual proposals are, they aren't going to do what people think they're going to do. There's a great, huge misconception about what the proposed laws actually would do,\" Slike said. Slike said the Indiana rally was organized by a small group who invested their own money to make it happen, including Slike and Jack Pupillo. The two also recently launched the Freedom Restoration Project, which is a grass-roots liberty movement that has begun in the wake of the heightened calls for gun control following the March 24 March for Our Lives rallies. Pupillo said he organized a counter-protest in Valparaiso to the marches. The students who organized the peaceful March for Our Lives Indianapolis protest were asking for stricter gun control laws, including expanding background checks and raising the age for gun permits. The events here and nationwide followed the February school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17, the latest in a years-long stretch of school and other mass shootings in the country. Gun debate: Man with rifle at March for Our Lives rally in Indianapolis stirs controversy On Saturday, Americans for America - Indiana joined a nationwide network of like-minded rallies to support their Second Amendment rights. A group called the National Constitutional Coalition of Patriotic Americans is spreading word of the gatherings on social media. Coalition co-founder David Clayton said organizers had permits for rallies Saturday in 45 states. He stressed that people should only bring guns in states where it’s legal. Buy Photo \nAmericans for America Indiana rally, a gun rights advocate organization, rallied at the Indiana State House on April 14, 2018. Organizers encouraged gun rights supporters to bring their unloaded rifles to the rally. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) About 500 people gathered at the peaceful Indianapolis event, which encouraged participants to bring their guns — unloaded — but keep them off government complex grounds, in accordance with the law. Some carried guns on the sidewalk by Washington Street but stayed off the Statehouse lawn. Speakers included State Rep. Jim Lucas; NRA instructor Tami Watson, who is running for Bartholomew County sheriff; and Joe Haney, who is with the YouTube channel 13C Gun Reviews, among several other candidates for office, current representatives and gun-rights advocates. Indiana Congressman Todd Rokita, who is running in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, also was there. Haney said he believes that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Department of Justice have muddied the distinction between classifications of semi-automatic weapons with vague language. \"At this point, there's no logical way to ban any certain class of semi-automatic firearms without banning them all,\" Haney said. Other speakers called for participants to teach gun safety, to speak to their state legislators and to attend school board meetings to make sure they are heard. Buy Photo \nAmericans for America Indiana rally, a gun rights advocate organization, rallied at the Indiana State House on April 14, 2018. Organizers encouraged gun rights supporters to bring their unloaded rifles to the rally. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) What stood out about Saturday's rally was the relative newness of grass-roots advocacy — both from the organizers and the crowd. One speaker asked how many people had not been to a Second Amendment rally before — and most cheered. Pupillo said gun control advocates have more practice with grass-roots events. So he is trying to learn more. \"We all have to get out there and start from a true grass-roots movement from the ground up,\" Pupillo said. Some of the signs at the rally were familiar, including images of the Confederate flag and early American patriots' symbol of a coiled snake with the words \"Don't Tread on Me.\" But there were other signs, too, including one that read \"If the 2nd (Amendment) doesn't apply to semi-automatic rifles today, then the first doesn't apply to the phone, TV and computers.\" One man also held a hand-made sign that read \"Two things I will die for are my sons and my guns.\" After about two hours of speeches, the marchers walked down Washington Street, continued up West Street to Ohio and then headed down Capitol back to the Statehouse. As they marched along the sidewalk, one man held up a sign at Washington Street and West streets that said “Good guys with guns.” There also was some honking of horns from the street as the marchers passed.

Whenever he came back to Indiana while he was on other teams, fans acted like he was still playing for the Hoosiers. I can’t tell you how special it feels when you think about how in only a few years, you can go from nobody knowing how to pronounce your name, to 20,000 people chanting it in unison. And I was on the opposing team. It was like that every time I came back. If I was playing for Orlando, Oklahoma City, it didn’t matter. If I ever went out in Indiana I was embraced by the people. Everyone remembered the years I played in college and talked about them like I was still on the team. Even when I was away, I was tied to Indiana. Indiana may not be a vacationers dream destination and a flyover state on the map, but that motivates not only Oladipo but the residents of Indiana. Maybe you’ve never been to Indiana. Or maybe you’ve just visited once or twice. Never even really thought about it. It’s a flyover state, right? One that’s easy to glance over on a map. And I bet that when you heard about the Thunder-Pacers trade, you were thinking about Paul George. Doma and I — we were a package deal, traded for the second time in a year, going to a non-contender in a flyover state. We know what it feels like to be overlooked. And so do a lot of guys on our team. And a lot of people in our arena. We know what it feels like when somebody gives up on you. More Pacers:"

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKevin De Bruyne combines the best of Paul Scholes and David Beckham, according to Gary Neville. \nThe former United man was on commentary duty at the Etihad for another Manchester City masterclass led by their Belgian playmaker . \nA superb pass helped create the opening goal before a beautiful strike thundered past Lukasz Fabianski for the third in a 5-0 rout of Swansea . \nDe Bruyne's awareness of the play around him and ability to always know where his teammates are has seen him draw comparisons with former United pass-master Scholes. \nHowever, the 26-year-old's long-range passing and striking of the ball recalled memories of another player Neville used to see every day. \n\"I actually think he is a hybrid between Scholes and David Beckham,\" he said . Read More Pep Guardiola insists Kevin de Bruyne deserved PFA award ahead of Liverpool's Mo Salah \n\"He can cross and pass in a whipped way like Beckham, but he can also strike and drift passes like Scholes. He has that blend of both in terms of how he plays. He's equally important to this team now as David Silva, and that's saying something because Silva is a sensational player.\" \nHaving been given more scope to influence matches this season, De Bruyne and Silva have orchestrated City's title win by making key contributions in important moments across the season. \nThe pair have been hailed as City's answer to Xavi and Andres Iniesta as any success Guardiola has is pitched against his great Barcelona team. \nThe coach has been keen to play down the idea that this Blues side can be considered one of the best yet, but for Neville they do have at least two players that deserve to be talked about in the same bracket. \n\"Jamie Redknapp said Xavi and Andres Iniesta were the best two he'd seen in those forward midfield positions, and you'd have to agree with that, they were the best I'd ever seen, the Barcelona team under Pep Guardiola,\" he added. \n\"But Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva are comparable, and that's saying something, because these are really top players. They don't waste the ball, they have the intelligence, understanding, it's really, really high level. \n\"One of the big moments of the season was De Bruyne's goal at Chelsea, one of the moments that made me think this is a different type of team this season. \n\"[The goal against Swansea] was a brilliant, brilliant strike. He has the ability to display different techniques, different types of passes, drifting a pass, bending a pass, whip a cross, and then to strike a ball so true. It can only be through repetition, hours and hours of practice.\" Like us on Facebook"
